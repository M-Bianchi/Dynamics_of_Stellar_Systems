% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
  \large The Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) is an HII region embedded within the Barnard 168 absorption nebula, making it a prime target for studying dust extinction. 
  We obtained photometric images of IC 5146 using H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ filters and analyzed the Balmer decrement to create a two-dimensional map of the color excess E(B-V), which serves as a proxy for dust column density. 
  Our results indicate a median E(B-V) of $\approx 0.461 \pm 0.008$ across the nebula, with a standard deviation of $\approx 0.34$. 
  A comparison with previous spectroscopic studies reveals a discrepancy in E(B-V) estimates, which we attribute to methodological differences in spatial sampling.\\
  Furthermore, given the nebula's nearly spherical morphology and its ionization by a single B0.5V-type star (BD+46 3474), we tested the Strömgren sphere model. 
  By incorporating literature values for electron density and temperature, as well as for the radius and temperature of BD+46 3474, we derived a Strömgren radius of $\approx 1.14$ pc, which is broadly consistent with the observed nebular size. 
  However, uncertainties in the nebula's distance and simplifying assumptions in the Strömgren model highlight the need for more detailed modeling.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
It is a well-established fact that most galaxies host a massive black hole (MBH) at their center, with masses ranging from a few million to several billion solar masses. In the latter case, these are referred to as supermassive black holes (SMBHs).
On the other hand, galactic mergers are expected to be frequent events in the Universe, and indeed we observe many galaxies in various stages of the merging process.
This raises the question of what happens to MBHs during these mergers.
The most likely outcome is the formation of a MBH binary at the center of the newly formed galaxy.
The process leading to the formation of such a binary is complex and involves several stages, which were originally outlined by \cite{Begelman1980}.

\subsection{Dynamical friction}\label{sec:introduction_dynamical_friction}
In this work, we focus on the process that causes the MBHs to sink towards the core of the merger remnant, a mechanism known as dynamical friction.
The main idea is that a massive object moving through a stellar system will transfer energy and angular momentum to the surrounding stars, slowing down and thus spiraling inward, toward the center of mass of the system. The object may gain speed as it moves into a region with deeper gravitational potential, which does not contradic the previous statement, since the total orbital energy is still decreasing.
The mathematical formalization of dynamical friction was first proposed by \cite{Chandrasekhar1943}, and it is based on the assumption that the stellar background is homogeneous and isotropic.
In particular, the perturber is subject to a deceleration given by the following equation:
{\fontsize{8.5pt}{8.5pt}\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{d\vec{v}_M}{dt} \, = \, -16 \pi^2 G^2 m \left(m+M\right) \ln \Lambda \left[\int^{v_M}_0 f(v_m) v_m^2 dv_m\right] \dfrac{\vec{v}_M}{v_M^3},
    \label{eq:chandrasekhar}
\end{equation}}
where $\ln \Lambda$ is the Coulomb logarithm (which depends on the maximum and minimum impact parameters of the interaction), $m$ is the mass of the background particles, $M$ is the mass of the perturber, and $f(v_m)$ is the distribution function of the background particles.

Once the MBHs have got close enough that the dynamics of one is dominated by the gravitational pull of the other, they will eventually form a binary system.
The critical separation can be approximated by the influence radius, i.e., the distance at which the gravitational potential of the MBH is comparable to the kinetic energy of the surrounding stars:
\begin{equation}
    r_\text{inf} = \dfrac{GM}{\sigma^2} \approx 1 \left(\dfrac{M}{10^6 M_\odot}\right) \left(\dfrac{\sigma}{65 \text{km/s}}\right)^{-2} \text{pc},
    \label{eq:influence_radius}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the stars surrounding the MBH.

, causing a sudden change in their orbital velocities.
It can be shown that dynamical friction is maximally efficient when $v_M \simeq v_m$, which is the typical inspiral scenario, while it swiftly becomes inefficient when the MBH binary forms.
The next step is to understand how the binary will evolve and whether it will merge or not.
