% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
  \large The Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) is an HII region embedded within the Barnard 168 absorption nebula, making it a prime target for studying dust extinction. 
  We obtained photometric images of IC 5146 using H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ filters and analyzed the Balmer decrement to create a two-dimensional map of the color excess E(B-V), which serves as a proxy for dust column density. 
  Our results indicate a median E(B-V) of $\approx 0.461 \pm 0.008$ across the nebula, with a standard deviation of $\approx 0.34$. 
  A comparison with previous spectroscopic studies reveals a discrepancy in E(B-V) estimates, which we attribute to methodological differences in spatial sampling.\\
  Furthermore, given the nebula's nearly spherical morphology and its ionization by a single B0.5V-type star (BD+46 3474), we tested the Strömgren sphere model. 
  By incorporating literature values for electron density and temperature, as well as for the radius and temperature of BD+46 3474, we derived a Strömgren radius of $\approx 1.14$ pc, which is broadly consistent with the observed nebular size. 
  However, uncertainties in the nebula's distance and simplifying assumptions in the Strömgren model highlight the need for more detailed modeling.
